# Rainfall Prediction System

![Rainfall Prediction System](images/rainfall_prediction.png)

## Overview

The Rainfall Prediction System is a machine learning-based project aimed at providing accurate rainfall predictions for the regions of Vavuniya, Anuradhapura, and Maha Illuppallama. The system utilizes ensemble methods and individual machine learning models to forecast rainfall patterns, assisting farmers and resource managers in making informed decisions related to agriculture and water management.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Historical rainfall data is collected from the Meteorological Department in Sri Lanka to build predictive models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to preprocess the collected data, ensuring its quality and relevance.
- **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including SARIMA, decision tree, random forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-value to assess its predictive performance.
- **MLOps Integration**: Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented for MLOps, ensuring seamless model updates and deployment.
